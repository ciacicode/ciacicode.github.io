      <description>Context As part of my UX Diploma, I had to work on a project from start to finish, to create a Mobile App for a fictional Airline called Fly UX.

      <description>The project started with an assessment of how Solution Engineers were running interviews. They were using a spreadsheet, endlessly scrolling to find questions, copy pasting answers and questions as they went along: a time consuming and uncomfortable experience.</description>
