      <description>Context As part of my UX Diploma, I had to work on a project from start to finish, to create a Mobile App for a fictional Airline called Fly UX.
The Challenge Airline apps are quite complex applications. Users&#39; goodwill can easily diminish, as there are some very intensive tasks, where the user is expected to provide loads of data, in a very short amount of time. All this, with limited screen space and guidance.</description>

      <description>Context Churn at HMA! at the time, was around 12 - 15%, but users unsubscribing were not asked to give a reason. This was putting us in the dark, as to what to improve.
The Challenge We wanted to learn what could be improved, we also wanted to highlight all the benefits that may be lost if they proceeded with the cancellation of the subscription. Achieving all this, without exasperating the user was the real challenge.</description>
