These about sections are usually filled with a lot of stuff that you can already find in my resume. Here is what you won’t find anywhere else:
* I love football and I am a massive Napoli fan (we did it! #napul3)
* I am a keen baker, but only just recently upgraded to a Kitchen Aid 😤
* My most used emojis are: 🤔 🤣 🧐 😱
* I also have a strong meme game.
* I am mother to a trilingual toddler that loves tractors.
