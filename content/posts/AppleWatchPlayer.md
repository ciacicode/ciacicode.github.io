## The Challenge

Wearable design is quite challenging as the real estate is very little and the interface needs to be designed with the motion in mind. 

## Design

I started by reading the [Apple guide for WatchOS design](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-watchos), where I learned more about the safe areas of the grid for WatchOs and the possible gestures that the device allows. I then moved on to some mid-fidelity wireframes.

The branding was conceived as a retro, playful brand using a typical note symbol as headphones, with fluo colors and black background to enhance contrast.

The typographical choice has been simple. Apple guidelines recommend the use of SF Compact, which I employed for the body, and I used Exo, a contemporary futuristic typeface that matched the branding well.

## Prototyping

Finally I moved on to the finalisation of a quick prototype in Figma, where gestures would be mimiced by dragging operations with some bounce effect, to keep that playfulness in the concept.
