# Context

A vast number of incoming customer support requests for the Web Search support team, were connected to privacy/legal questions. Routing these requests to legal teams, required a lot of time, and often lead to standardised answers to users, whether instead simple answers could be found on existing support resources.


# The Challenge

As a support team, we only had control of support centers, and the Privacy Help Center at the time, was in its infancy. The content available on all other support center was vast, but the wording of questions had to be reviewed by legal at every step.

# Research and Analysis

We started with a quantitative analysis of top questions. 

**Removing search results**
<br>It's very common to think that Google controls the search results, so, if any result was felt as inappropriate by users, they used to contact Google to remove it. 

**Account Access**
<br>Forgotten passwords, switched accounts on shared computers all contributed to create a sense of violation of the account that was leading users to get in touch with Google.


**User Journey**
We knew the present journey by heart. The users would somehow locate the only form to contact Google about a legal question, missing all other content entirely. So we designed a user journey that made sure that legal form would be preceded by a troubleshooter first.
         
# Design

We started with information architecture, as the design of the solution would have been limited by the existing content management system for support. We took two parallel approaches and tested both. 

**Goal Oriented**
Content was organised in categories that were created after a card sorting exercise with a set of real users.

**Product Oriented**
Content was organised by products.

# Validate

We prepared scenarios reflecting the most common user questions, and observed how the pariticipants went about finding an answer in both types of prototypes. We saw that the product organisation performed better, as the users left the troubleshooter more quickly and happy about the answers.


# Finalise

We then went into a phase of iteration to finalise wording with the legal team and once published, the tickets dropped by 59% within 3 weeks from launch.
