# Context

The SAFE Foundation is a charity operating in South London, using the power of football to each young children to live healthily. It organises several sport programmes for different ages, focusing on good sport ethics.

# The Challenge

The charity had lost access to the assets of their website, so needed a new website and a new brand. While I had contributed to rebrandings, I was never in charge of one. This project gave me the opportunity of owning the process from start to end. 

# Research and Analysis

To get started I asked John, the CEO, a lot of questions about the charity. The whats the and the whys of the foundation. I got access to the original branding and found out:

**Yellow as primary colour**
<br>The main logo had Yellow as a primary colour, a colour that is quite hard to work with for contrast reasons. 

**Children programmes**
<br>The charity organises all sorts of programmes and events for children across different South London areas. Those events need to be attractive and available for bookings.

I decided I would create a brand guideline, with logo, colour and typography guidelines to deliver to the Foundation and help me get started on the web development part of the project.
            
# Design and Colour

I worked on the logo first. I started using the original logo, but then evolved it further to make it more modern and playful. More fit for the audience that I thought would engage with the Foundation.

The primary colours were picked after looking at SAFE Foundation official sportswear.

# Typography

After I was happy with the logo, I created typography guidelines. I opted for Rubik, because it offered great redability and had all those elements of playfulness and roundness that I was looking for in a typeface.

# Finalise

I went ahead and developed the foundation's website using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed it on CloudCannon, to make it easier for the foundation personnel to edit the content of the file through a CMS. It is currently available at [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
