# Context


As part of my UX Diploma, I had to work on a project from start to finish, to create a Mobile App for a fictional Airline called Fly UX. 

# The Challenge


Airline apps are quite complex applications: users goodwill can easily diminish, as there are some very intensive tasks, where the user is expected to provide loads of data, in a very short amount of time, with limited screen space and guidance. I had created sign-up and cancellation flows before for other websites as a PM, but in this case I had to create all error flows as well on my own.

# Research and Analysis

I have run usability studies and interviews, to get an understanding of context, goals and behaviours of flyers. With that information I designed user journey map and affinity diagram. From the start, price and time emerged as the most important factors of decision making:

**Price confusion**
<br>Switching between 'Price per person' and 'Total price' was often not clear, and created some serious disappointments in users that felt cheated or tricked by the way the information on price was displayed.

**Direct flights vs Stops**
<br>In some cases the users only found out very late that the flights they ended up selecting, included a layover stop that lasted several hours. This was due to the lack of UX/UI emphasis on such a key piece of information.

**Passenger info Pain**
<br>The most painful and time consuming task was the completion of passenger information. The apps that performed the best were those that made this step as simple as possible, with prefilled form fields and minimal inputs required.

**User Journey**

# Design

The first step was to create a clear user flow that would be comprehensive of happy path and unhappy path. The key challenge was not to focus on screens and controls, but the flow of the user, in, out and around their primary goal.

After designing the flow, I concentrated on the key interactions, such as passenger info input and date selection. Finally I moved to wireframes and prototyping with Figma. 

# Validate

I submitted the prototype to a group of users and gained some very valuable insights:

**Insights 1**
<br>The problem we wanted to solve was making sure people apply. This design delivers the best impact to solve that problem. Providing the context through photos and good copywriting was the only challenge left, since it's a landing page.

**Insights 2**
<br>The problem we wanted to solve was making sure people apply. This design delivers the best impact to solve that problem. Providing the context through photos and good copywriting was the only challenge left, since it's a landing page.

# Finalise

All the feedback went into the final prototype.
