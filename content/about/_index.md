# meta description
description: "I am a product designer with more than 10 years experience in B2B and B2C web and mobile applications. I work to find the sweet spot between user value and business value. I like to start my process with research and very clear success criteria. This allows me to clarify any doubt from the start, making the design process more purposeful and, in my experience, quicker. I like to learn by reading articles online, taking design and coding classes, so that I am always up to date with the latest trends and technologies. I define myself as a designer, as I am firstly a problem solver combinining design, technology and business acumen."
